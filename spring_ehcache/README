# Simple Ehcache 2 Sample with Spring

A couple of examples of how to use Ehcache with Spring.

## Running the samples

### No-Cache

Simple service call that return sample data and use a "sleep" time to mock a long duration call.

 mvn compile exec:exec -P nocache

### Use Ehcache CacheManager natively
Create Ehcache CacheManager bean and autowire it throughout your app for full cache-usage granularity.
Instrument the same simple service to use Ehcache, and notice the difference on the >1 iteration of service calls.

  mvn compile exec:exec -P ehcache-native

### Use Spring Cache Abstraction
Leverage the Cache Spring Abstraction (via spring EhCacheManagerFactoryBean and spring CacheManager beans)
to use the spring Cache Annotations such as @Cacheable, @CacheEvict, @CachePut, @CacheConfig and etc, as defined in the official [Spring Cache Abstraction documentation](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/cache.html)
Instrument the same simple service with @Cacheable annotation, and notice the difference on the >1 iteration of service calls.

 mvn compile exec:exec -P ehcache-spring-abstraction
