== Spring Boot - Samples - CXF Rest Web Services 

This sample project demonstrates how to use CXF JAX-RS services
with Spring Boot. This demo has two JAX-RS class resources being deployed in a single JAX-RS endpoint.  

The sample uses Maven. It can be built and run from the command line:

----
$ mvn -Pserver
----

http://localhost:8080/services/helloservice/sayHello/ApacheCxfUser

will display "Hello ApacheCxfUser, Welcome to CXF RS Spring Boot World!!!"

http://localhost:8080/services/helloservice/sayHello2/ApacheCxfUser

will display "Hello2 ApacheCxfUser, Welcome to CXF RS Spring Boot World!!!"

Try with cache this time:

http://localhost:8080/services/helloservice/sayHelloWithCache/test

will first display "1492630660099 - hello1 test-1492630657688 (hello1) (From Cache? false), Welcome to CXF RS Spring Boot World!!!"

But retrying one more time will display "1492630660099 - hello1 test-1492630657688 (hello1) (From Cache? true), Welcome to CXF RS Spring Boot World!!!"
(notice same timestamp and From Cache = true)

http://localhost:8080/services/helloservice/sayHelloWithCache2/test

1492630800037 - hello2 test-1492630795755 (Hello2) (From Cache? false), Welcome to CXF RS Spring Boot World!!!

1492630800037 - hello2 test-1492630795755 (Hello2) (From Cache? true), Welcome to CXF RS Spring Boot World!!!


http://localhost:8080/services/helloservice/swagger.json will return a Swagger JSON
description of services.
